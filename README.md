# useful-pipelines
A place to store my pipeline work. Probably only suited for supervised learning problems. Making this private so the students I TA for don't just hijack large portions of the code. But with ChatGPT out now... maybe thats irrelevant these days.

Classification pipeline is intended to work for both binary and multi-class classification
Regression pipeline will later be made based largely off the binary classification code.

To do's:
Fix multi-class classification visualizations
Create Regression pipeline
    - what visualizations?
    - normalizations?
    - maybe a lot more error metrics than classification
